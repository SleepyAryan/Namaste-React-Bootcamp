--> learnt how to render element using html, javascript and react.
--> there is one way to import react in html i.e. by using CDN.
--> there are 2 script tags:
   -> to access elements of react:
    <script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
  ></script>

   -> to update the DOM:
  <script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
  ></script>

--> need to import these tags before accessing them on code.
